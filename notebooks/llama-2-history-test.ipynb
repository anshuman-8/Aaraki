As you\\nhave read, before the eighteenth century society was broadly divided\\ninto estates and orders and it was the aristocracy and church which\\ncontrolled economic and social power. Suddenly, after the revolution,\\nit seemed possible to change this. In many parts of the world including\\nEurope and Asia, new ideas about individual rights and who\\ncontrolled social power began to be discussed. In India, Raja\\nRammohan Roy and Derozio talked of the significance of the French\\nRevolution, and many others debated the ideas of post-revolutionary\\nEurope. The developments in the colonies, in turn, reshaped these\\nideas of societal change.\\nNot everyone in Europe, however, wanted a complete transformation\\nof society. Responses varied from those who accepted that some\\nchange was necessary but wished for a gradual shift, to those who\\nwanted to restructure society radically. Some were ‘conservatives’,\\nothers were ‘liberals’ or ‘radicals’. What did these terms really mean\\nin the context of the time? What separated these strands of politics\\nand what linked them together? We must remember that these terms\\ndo not mean the same thing in all contexts or at all times.\\nWe will look briefly at some of the important political traditions of\\nthe nineteenth century, and see how they influenced change. Then\\nwe will focus on one historical event in which there was an attempt\\nat a radical transformation of society. Through the revolution in\\nRussia, socialism became one of the most significant and powerful\\nideas to shape society in the twentieth century.\\n1.1 Liberals, Radicals and Conservatives\\nOne of the groups which looked to change society were the liberals.\\nLiberals wanted a nation which tolerated all religions. We should\\nremember that at this time European states usually discriminated in\\nSociali sm in Eur ope and the Ru ssian Re volution Chapter II\\nRationalised 2023-24\\n', metadata={'source': '../datasets/Social/iess302.pdf', 'page': 0}), Document(page_content='India and the Contemporary World\\n26favour of one religion or another (Britain favoured the Church of\\nEngland, Austria and Spain favoured the Catholic Church). Liberals\\nalso opposed the uncontrolled power of dynastic rulers. They wanted\\nto safeguard the rights of individuals against governments. They\\nargued for a representative, elected parliamentary government, subject\\nto laws interpreted by a well-trained judiciary that was independent\\nof rulers and officials. However, they were not ‘democrats’. They\\ndid not believe in universal adult franchise, that is, the right of every\\ncitizen to vote. They felt men of property mainly should have the\\nvote. They also did not want the vote for women.\\nIn contrast, radicals wanted a nation in which government was based\\non the majority of a country’s population. Many supported women’s\\nsuffragette  movements. Unlike liberals, they opposed the privileges\\nof great landowners and wealthy factory owners. They were not\\nagainst the existence of private property but disliked concentration\\nof property in the hands of a few.\\nConservatives were opposed to radicals and liberals. After the French\\nRevolution, however, even conservatives had opened their minds to\\nthe need for change. Earlier, in the eighteenth century, conservatives\\nhad been generally opposed to the idea of change. By the nineteenth\\ncentury, they accepted that some change was inevitable but believed\\nthat the past had to be respected and change had to be brought about\\nthrough a slow process.\\nSuch differing ideas about societal change clashed during the social\\nand political turmoil that followed the French Revolution. The\\nvarious attempts at revolution and national transformation in the\\nnineteenth century helped define both the limits and potential of\\nthese political tendencies.\\n1.2 Industrial Society and Social Change\\nThese political trends were signs of a new time. It was a time of\\nprofound social and economic changes. It was a time when new cities\\ncame up and new industrialised regions developed,  railways expanded\\nand the Industrial Revolution occurred.\\nIndustrialisation brought men, women and children to factories.  Work\\nhours were often long and wages were poor. Unemployment was\\ncommon, particularly during times of low demand for industrial goods.\\nHousing and sanitation were problems since towns were growing\\nrapidly. Liberals and radicals searched for solutions to these issues.New words\\nSuffragette movement – A movement to\\ngive women the right to vote.\\nRationalised 2023-24\\n', metadata={'source': '../datasets/Social/iess302.pdf', 'page': 1}), Document(page_content='Socialism in Europe and the Russian Revolution\\n27\\nAlmost all industries were the property of individuals.  Liberals and\\nradicals themselves were often property owners and employers.\\nHaving made their wealth through trade or industrial ventures, they\\nfelt that such effort should be encouraged – that its benefits would\\nbe achieved if the workforce in the economy was healthy and citizens\\nwere educated. Opposed to the privileges the old aristocracy had by\\nbirth, they firmly believed in the value of individual effort, labour\\nand enterprise. If freedom of individuals was ensured, if the poor\\ncould labour, and those with capital could operate without restraint,\\nthey believed that societies would develop. Many working men and\\nwomen who wanted changes in the world rallied around liberal and\\nradical groups and parties in the early nineteenth century.\\nSome nationalists, liberals and radicals wanted revolutions to put an\\nend to the kind of governments established in Europe in 1815. In\\nFrance, Italy, Germany and Russia, they became revolutionaries and\\nworked to overthrow existing monarchs. Nationalists talked of\\nrevolutions that would create ‘nations’ where all citizens would haveFig.1 – The London poor in the mid-nineteenth century as seen by a\\ncontemporary.\\nFrom: Henry Mayhew, London Labour and the London Poor, 1861.\\nRationalised 2023-24\\n', metadata={'source': '../datasets/Social/iess302.pdf', 'page': 2}), Document(page_content='India and the Contemporary World\\n28Activityequal rights. After 1815, Giuseppe Mazzini, an Italian nationalist, conspired\\nwith others to achieve this in Italy. Nationalists elsewhere – including India\\n– read his writings.\\n1.3 The Coming of Socialism to Europe\\nPerhaps one of the most far-reaching visions of how society should be\\nstructured was socialism. By the mid - nineteenth century in Europe, socialism\\nwas a well-known body of ideas that attracted widespread attention.\\nSocialists were against private property, and saw it as the root of all social ills\\nof the time. Why? Individuals owned the property that gave employment\\nbut the propertied were concerned only with  personal gain and not with\\nthe welfare of those who made the property productive. So if society as a\\nwhole rather than single individuals controlled property, more attention\\nwould be paid to collective social interests. Socialists wanted this change and\\ncampaigned for it.\\nHow could a society without property operate? What would be the basis of\\nsocialist society?\\nSocialists had different visions of the future. Some believed in the idea of\\ncooperatives. Robert Owen (1771-1858), a leading English manufacturer,\\nsought to build a cooperative community called New Harmony in Indiana\\n(USA). Other socialists felt that cooperatives could not be built on a wide\\nscale onl y through indi vidual initia tive: they demanded tha t governments\\nencourage cooperatives. In France, for instance, Louis Blanc (1813-1882)\\nwanted the government to encourage cooperatives and replace capitalist\\nenterprises. These cooperatives were to be associations of people who\\nproduced goods together and divided the profits according to the work\\ndone by members.\\nKarl Marx (1818-1883) and Friedrich Engels (1820-1895) added other ideas\\nto this body of arguments. Marx argued that industrial society was ‘capitalist’.\\nCapitalists owned the capital invested in factories, and the profit of capitalists\\nwas produced by workers.  The conditions of workers could not improve\\nas long as this profit was accumulated by private capitalists. Workers had to\\noverthrow capitalism and the rule of private property. Marx believed that\\nto free themselves from capitalist exploitation, workers had to construct a\\nradically socialist society where all property was socially controlled. This\\nwould be a communist society. He was convinced that workers would\\ntriumph in their conflict with capitalists. A communist society was the natural\\nsociety of the future.List two differences between the capitalist\\nand socialist ideas of private property .\\nRationalised 2023-24\\n', metadata={'source': '../datasets/Social/iess302.pdf', 'page': 3}), Document(page_content='Socialism in Europe and the Russian Revolution\\n29Activity1.4 Support for Socialism\\nBy the 1870s, socialist ideas spread through Europe. To coordinate\\ntheir efforts, socialists formed an international body – namely, the\\nSecond International.\\nWorkers in England and Germany began forming associations to\\nfight for better living and working conditions. They set up funds to\\nhelp members in times of distress and demanded a reduction of working\\nhours and the right to v ote. In Ger many, these associa tions w orked closely\\nwith the Social Democratic Party (SPD) and helped it win parliamentary\\nseats. By 1905,  socialists and tr ade unionists f ormed a La bour P arty in\\nBritain and a Socialist Party in France. However, till 1914, socialists never\\nsucceeded in f orming a g overnment in Eur ope.

It portray s a scene from the\\npopular uprising in Paris between March and May 1871. This was a period when the town council ( commune ) of Paris was\\ntaken over by a ‘peoples’ government’ consisting of workers, ordinary people, professionals, political activists and others.\\nThe uprising emerged against a background of growing discontent against the policies of the French state. The ‘Paris\\nCommune’ was ultimately crushed by government troops but it was celebrated by Socialists the world over as a prelude to a\\nsocialist revolution.The Paris Commune  is also popularly remembered for two important legacies: one, for its association with\\nthe workers’ red flag – that was the flag adopted by the communards ( revolutionaries) in Paris; two, for the ‘Marseillaise’,\\noriginally written as a war song in 1792, it became a symbol of the Commune and of the struggle for liberty.\\nRationalised 2023-24\\n', metadata={'source': '../datasets/Social/iess302.pdf', 'page': 4}), Document(page_content='India and the Contemporary World\\n302  The Russian Revolution\\nIn one of the least industrialised of European states this situation was\\nreversed. Socialists took over the government in Russia through the\\nOctober Revolution of 1917. The fall of monarchy in February 1917\\nand the events of October are normally called the Russian Revolution.\\nHow did this come about? What were the social and political\\nconditions in Russia when the revolution occurred? To answer these\\nquestions, let us look at Russia a few years before the revolution.\\n2.1 The Russian Empire in 19 14\\nIn 1914, Tsar Nicholas II ruled Russia and its empire. Besides the\\nterritory around Moscow, the Russian empire included current-day\\nFinland, Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia, parts of Poland, Ukraine and\\nBelarus. It stretched to the Pacific and comprised today’s Central\\nAsian states, as well as Georgia, Armenia and Azerbaijan. The majority\\nreligion was Russian Orthodox Christianity – which had grown out\\nof the Greek Orthodox Church – but the empire also  included\\nCatholics, Protestants, Muslims and Buddhists.\\nFig.3 – Tsar Nicholas II in the White\\nHall of the Winter Palace,\\nSt Petersburg, 1900.\\nPainted by Earnest Lipgart (1847-1932)\\nFig.4 – Europe in 1914.\\nThe map shows the Russian empire and the European countries at war during the First\\nWorld War.\\nRationalised 2023-24\\n', metadata={'source': '../datasets/Social/iess302.pdf', 'page': 5}), Document(page_content='Socialism in Europe and the Russian Revolution\\n312.2 Economy and Society\\nAt the beginning of the twentieth century, the vast majority of\\nRussia’s people were agriculturists. About 85 per cent of the Russian\\nempire’s population earned their living from agriculture. This\\nproportion was higher than in most European countries. For instance,\\nin France and Germany the proportion was between 40 per cent and\\n50 per cent. In the empire, cultivators produced for the market as\\nwell as for their own needs and Russia was a major exporter of grain.\\nIndustry was found in pockets. Prominent industrial areas were\\nSt Petersburg and Moscow. Craftsmen undertook much of the\\nproduction, but large factories existed alongside craft workshops.\\nMany factories were set up in the 1890s, when Russia’s railway\\nnetwork was extended, and foreign investment in industry increased.\\nCoal production doubled and iron and steel output quadrupled. By\\nthe 1900s, in some areas factory workers and craftsmen were almost\\nequal in number.\\nMost industry was the private property of industrialists. Government\\nsupervised large factories to ensure minimum wages and limited hours\\nof work. But factory inspectors could not prevent rules being broken.\\nIn craft units and small workshops, the working day was sometimes\\n15 hours, compared with 10 or 12 hours in factories. Accommodation\\nvaried from rooms to dormitories.\\nWorkers were a divided social group. Some had strong links with\\nthe villages from which they came. Others had settled in cities\\npermanently. Workers were divided by skill. A metalworker of St.\\nPetersburg recalled, ‘Metalworkers considered themselves aristocrats\\namong other workers. Their occupations demanded more training\\nand skill . . . ’ Women made up 31 per cent of the factory labour\\nforce by 1914, but they were paid less than men (between half and\\nthree-quarters of a man’s wage). Divisions among workers showed\\nthemselves in dress and manners too. Some workers formed\\nassociations to help members in times of unemployment or financial\\nhardship b ut suc h associa tions w ere few.\\nDespite divisions, workers did unite to strike work (stop work) when\\nthey disagreed with employers about dismissals or work conditions.\\nThese strikes took place  frequently in the textile industry during\\n1896-1897, and in the metal industry during 1902.\\nIn the countryside, peasants cultivated most of the land. But the\\nnobility, the crown and the Orthodox Church owned large\\nproperties. Like workers, peasants too were divided.

But except in a few cases they had no respect for the\\nnobility. Nobles got their power and position through their services\\nto the Tsar, not through local popularity. This was unlike France\\nwhere, during the French Revolution in Brittany, peasants respected\\nnobles and fought for them. In Russia, peasants wanted the land of\\nthe nobles to be given to them. Frequently, they refused to pay rent\\nand even murdered landlords. In 1902, this occurred on a large scale\\nin south Russia. And in 1905,  such incidents took place all\\nover Russia.\\nRussian peasants were different from other European peasants in\\nanother way. They pooled their land together periodically and their\\ncommune ( mir) divided it according to the needs of individual families.\\n2.3 Socialism in Russia\\nAll political parties were illegal in Russia before 1914. The Russian\\nSocial Democratic Workers Party was founded in 1898 by socialists\\nwho respected Marx’s ideas. However, because of government\\npolicing, it had to operate as an illegal organisation. It set up a\\nnewspaper, mobilised workers and organised strikes.\\nSome Russian socialists felt that the Russian peasant custom of dividing\\nland periodically made them natural socialists. So peasants, not\\nworkers, would be the main force of the revolution, and Russia could\\nbecome socialist more quickly than other countries. Socialists were\\nactive in the countryside through the late nineteenth century.  They\\nformed the Socialist Revolutionary Party in 1900. This party struggled\\nfor peasants’ rights and demanded that land belonging to nobles be\\ntransferred to peasants. Social Democrats disagreed with Socialist\\nRevolutionaries about peasants. Lenin felt that peasants were not\\none united group. Some were poor and others rich, some worked as\\nlabourers while others were capitalists who employed workers. Given\\nthis ‘differentiation’ within them, they could not all be part of a\\nsocialist movement.\\nThe party was divided over the strategy of organisation. Vladimir\\nLenin (who led the Bolshevik group) thought that in a repressive\\nsociety like Tsarist Russia the party should be disciplined and should\\ncontrol the number and quality of its members.  Others (Mensheviks)\\nthought that the party should be open to all (as in Germany).\\n2.4 A Turbulent Time: The 1905 Revolution\\nRussia was an autocracy .

Liberals in Russia campaigned to end this state of affairs.\\nTogether with the Social Democrats and Socialist Revolutionaries,\\nthey worked with peasants and workers during the revolution of\\n1905 to demand a constitution. They were supported in the empire\\nby nationalists (in Poland for instance) and in Muslim-dominated\\nareas by jadidists  who wanted modernised Islam to lead their societies.\\nThe year 1904 was a particularly bad one for Russian workers. Prices\\nof essential goods rose so quickly that real wages  declined by 20 per\\ncent. The membership of workers’ associations rose dramatically.\\nWhen four members of the Assembly of Russian Workers, which\\nhad been formed in 1904, were dismissed at the Putilov Iron Works,\\nthere was a call for industrial action. Over the next few days over\\n110,000 workers in St Petersburg went on strike demanding a\\nreduction in the working day to eight hours, an increase in wages\\nand improvement in working conditions.\\nWhen the procession of workers led by Father Gapon reached the\\nWinter Palace it was attacked by the police and the Cossacks. Over\\n100 workers were killed and about 300 wounded. The incident,\\nknown as Bloody Sunday, started a series of events that became known\\nas the 1905 Revolution. Strikes took place all over the country and\\nuniversities closed down when student bodies staged walkouts,\\ncomplaining about the lack of civil liberties. Lawyers, doctors,\\nengineers and other middle-class workers established the Union of\\nUnions and demanded a constituent assembly.\\nDuring the 1905 Revolution, the Tsar allowed the creation of an\\nelected consultative Parliament or Duma. For a brief while during\\nthe revolution, there existed a large number of trade unions and\\nfactory committees made up of factory workers. After 1905, most\\ncommittees and unions worked unofficially, since they were declared\\nillegal. Severe restrictions were placed on political activity. The Tsar\\ndismissed the first Duma within 75 days and the re-elected second\\nDuma within three months. He did not want any questioning of his\\nauthority or any reduction in his power. He changed the voting\\nlaws and packed the third Duma with conservative politicians. Liberals\\nand revolutionaries were kept out.\\n2.5 The First World War and the Russian Empire\\nIn 1914, war broke out between two European alliances – Germany,\\nAustria and Turkey (the Central powers) and France, Britain and\\nRussia  (later Italy and Romania).

When this\\narmy shifted its loyalty and began supporting\\nthe revolutionaries, Tsarist power collapsed.and the war was fought outside Europe as well as\\nin Europe. This was the First World War.\\nIn Russia, the war was initially popular and people\\nrallied around Tsar Nicholas II. As the war\\ncontinued, though, the Tsar refused to consult the\\nmain parties in the Duma. Support wore thin. Anti-\\nGerman sentiments ran high,  as can be seen in the\\nrenaming of St Petersburg – a German name – as\\nPetrograd. The Tsarina Alexandra’s German\\norigins and poor advisers, especially a monk called\\nRasputin, made the autocracy unpopular.\\nThe First World War on the ‘eastern front’ differed\\nfrom that on the ‘western front’. In the west, armies\\nfought from trenches stretched along eastern\\nFrance. In the east, armies moved a good deal and\\nfought battles leaving large casualties. Defeats were\\nshocking and demoralising. Russia’s armies lost\\nbadly in Germany and Austria  between 1914 and\\n1916. There were over 7 million casualties by 1917.\\nAs they retreated, the Russian army destroyed\\ncrops and buildings to prevent the enemy from\\nbeing able to live off the land. The destruction of\\ncrops and buildings led to over 3 million refugees in Russia. The\\nsituation discredited the government and the Tsar.  Soldiers did not\\nwish to fight such a war.\\nThe war also had a severe impact on industry. Russia’s own industries\\nwere few in number and  the country was cut off from other suppliers\\nof industrial goods by German control of the Baltic Sea. Industrial\\nequipment disintegrated more rapidly in Russia than elsewhere in\\nEurope. By 1916, railway lines began to break down. Able-bodied\\nmen were called up to the war. As a result, there were labour shortages\\nand small workshops producing essentials were shut down. Large\\nsupplies of grain were sent to feed the army. For the people in the\\ncities, bread and flour  became scarce.

Industrial production increased (between 1929 and 1933 by\\n100 per cent in the case of oil, coal and steel). New factory cities\\ncame into being.\\nHowever, rapid construction led to poor working conditions. In\\nthe city of Magnitogorsk, the construction of a steel plant was achieved\\nin three years.

By 1927-\\n1928, the towns in Soviet Russia were facing an acute\\nproblem of grain supplies. The government fixed prices\\nat which grain must be sold, but the  peasants refused to sell their\\ngrain to government buyers at these prices.\\nStalin, who headed the party after the death of Lenin, introduced\\nfirm emergency measures. He believed that rich peasants and traders\\nin the countryside were holding stocks in the hope of higher prices.\\nSpeculation had to be stopped and supplies confiscated.\\nIn 1928, Party members toured the grain-producing areas, supervising\\nenforced grain collections, and raiding ‘kulaks’ –  the name for well-\\nto-do peasants. As shortages continued, the decision was taken to\\ncollectivise farms. It was argued that grain shortages were partly due\\nto the small size of holdings. After 1917, land had been  given over to\\npeasants. These small-sized peasant farms could not be modernised.\\nTo develop modern farms, and run them along industrial lines with\\nmachinery, it was necessary to ‘eliminate kulaks’, take away land\\nfrom peasants, and establish state-controlled large farms.\\nWhat followed was Stalin’s collectivisation programme. From 1929,\\nthe Party forced all peasants to cultivate in collective farms ( kolkhoz ).\\nThe bulk of land and implements were transferred to the ownership\\nof collective farms. Peasants worked on the land, and the kolkhoz\\nprofit was shared. Enraged peasants resisted the authorities and\\ndestroyed their livestock. Between 1929 and 1931, the number of\\ncattle fell by one-third. Those who resisted collectivisation were\\nseverely punished. Many were deported  and exiled . As they resisted\\ncollectivisation, peasants argued that they were not rich and they\\nwere not against socialism. They merely did not want to work in\\ncollective farms for a variety of reasons. Stalin’s government allowed\\nsome independent cultivation, but treated such cultivators\\nunsympathetically.\\nIn spite of collectivisation, production did not increase immediately.\\nIn fact, the bad harvests of 1930-1933 led to one of most devastating\\nfamines in Soviet history when over 4 million died.\\nFig.18 – A poster during collectivisation.

However, the possibility\\nof a workers’ state fired people’s imagination across the world. In\\nmany countries, communist parties were formed – like the\\nCommunist Party of Great Britain. The Bolsheviks encouraged\\ncolonial peoples to follow their experiment. Many non-Russians from\\noutside the USSR participated in the Conference of the Peoples of\\nthe East (1920) and the Bolshevik-founded Comintern (an international\\nunion of pro-Bolshevik socialist parties). Some received education in\\nthe USSR’s Communist University of the Workers of the East. By\\nthe time of the outbreak of the Second World War, the USSR had\\ngiven socialism a global face and world stature.\\nYet by the 1950s it was acknowledged within the country that the\\nstyle of government in the USSR was not in keeping with the ideals\\nof the Russian Revolution. In the world socialist movement too it\\nwas recognised that all was not well in the Soviet Union. A backward\\ncountry had become a great power. Its industries and agriculture\\nhad developed and the poor were being fed. But it had denied the\\nessential freedoms to its citizens and carried out its developmental\\nprojects through repressive policies. By the end of the twentieth\\ncentury, the international reputation of the USSR as a socialist\\ncountry had declined though it was recognised that socialist ideals\\nstill enjoyed respect among its people. But in each country the ideas\\nof socialism were rethought in a variety of different ways.5  The Global Influence of the Russian\\nRevolution and the USSR\\nWriting about the Russian Revolution in India\\nAmong those the Russian Revolution inspired were many Indians.
